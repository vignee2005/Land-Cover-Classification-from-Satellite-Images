# Land-Cover-Classification-from-Satellite-Images

To develop and evaluate a comprehensive image classification system for satellite imagery using various machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to classify images into different land cover categories, including Forest, Highway, Industrial, Pasture, Residential, River, and SeaLake. The project encompasses:

1. **Image Data Processing:**

   * Load and preprocess satellite imagery from diverse land cover classes.
   * Extract and normalize features for effective model training.

2. **Model Development:**

   * **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Build and train a CNN to classify images based on learned features from the dataset.
   * **Traditional Machine Learning Models:**

     * **Random Forest Classifier:** Utilize ensemble learning to enhance classification accuracy.
     * **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Apply dimensionality reduction through PCA and classify images using SVM.
     * **XGBoost:** Leverage gradient boosting techniques for robust classification performance.

3. **Evaluation and Comparison:**

   * Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   * Analyze confusion matrices to understand model strengths and weaknesses.
   * Visualize class-wise accuracies to identify areas of improvement.

4. **Image Classification:**

   * Implement functionality to classify new images using the trained models.
   * Compare predictions across different models for consistency and reliability.

**Expected Outcome:**

* A robust classification system capable of accurately identifying land cover types in satellite imagery.
* Comparative analysis of different models to determine the most effective approach for the given dataset.
